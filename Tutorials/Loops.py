# While Loop
count = 1
while count < 10:
   print(count)
   count += 1 

print("\n\n")

# While loop works like this
# Start from 1 and then if count < 10 continue
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
# and then on 10 Stop this code

# For Loop
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# For loop works like this
# for i in range(start, end), 
# defualt for start = 0
# range() uses indexes start = startindex etc.
# so start from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# which makes lenghth of 10 numbers
